I wish you many more years to come, for you to get as old as we are and enjoy the life experiences. I am glad I got to meet a person such as yourself, it's been a ride knowing you in the past year and a couple of months. Since the day I met you during the selection program when you arrived late as usual at campus. It's been a joy meeting and knowing someone more weirder than me and more fun. I hope to see you grow and be the amazing person you are and hope to be there for more birthdays to come.",
